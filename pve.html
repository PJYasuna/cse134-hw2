When you are a beginner, you will start the main story from <strong>Episode 6</strong>. It’s quite easy to finish. <br>
After that, you will begin your main story in <strong>Episode 7</strong>.
</p>

<p>
For your team, you should use <br>
<img src="images/Tieria.png" alt="Free Spirit Tieria" width="100"><br>
as your main attacker. This hero is free, and you should level her up to complete some beginner missions.
</p>

<p>
As a beginner, you’ll also receive a <strong>free selective summon</strong>, which allows you to choose one of the <strong>5★ heroes</strong> (Fire, Nature, or Ice). <br>
I recommend picking <br>
<img src="images/feijian.png" alt="Iseria" width="100">
</p>

<p>
You can also obtain another important PvE hero, <br>
<img src="images/ouxiang.png" alt="Tamarinne" width="100"> <br>
by completing side missions at the bar or by pulling her if you don’t want to wait.
</p>

<p>
Finally, use your main character <br>
<img src="images/ras.png" alt="Ras" width="100"><br>
and you’ll have a great beginner team:
</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">
<img src="images/Tieria.png" alt="Free Spirit Tieria" width="100">
<img src="images/feijian.png" alt="Iseria" width="100">
<img src="images/ouxiang.png" alt="Tamarinne" width="100">
<img src="images/ras.png" alt="Ras" width="100">
</p>

<p>
Keep progressing through the main story, and continue leveling up these four characters and their gears. <br>
If you get stuck on some stages, upgrading their equipment will help.

<p>
For the <strong>Moonlight free choice</strong>, I recommend two heroes:
</p>

<p>
<strong>1. Executor Vildred</strong><br>
<img src="images/andi.png" alt="Executor Vildred" width="100"><br>
He has very high damage and can <strong>revive himself</strong>, which helps you clear PvE stages faster. <br>
You can replace <img src="images/Tieria.png" alt="Free Spirit Tieria" width="60"> with him later. <br>
</p>

<p>
<strong>2. Ruele of Light</strong><br>
<img src="images/ruier.png" alt="Ruele of Light" width="100"><br>
She is a very powerful <strong>Soul Weaver</strong> who can <strong>revive allies</strong>. <br>
Ruele is more popular than Vildred in PvP, but if you want a smoother PvE experience early on, <br>
it’s better to choose <strong>Vildred first</strong> and replace him with <strong>Ruele</strong> later when you can.
